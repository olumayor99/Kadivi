# Kadivi
A collaborative DevOps repo.

# First task - 26 November, 2022

Add your names/nicknames below the line. Kindly use single line spacing. You need to pull the repo to your local machine, checkout a branch (name the branch your github username), make your changes (add your name to this file), commit your code and push it to this repository, then create a pull request for the commit targeting the main branch.

# Second Task - 27 November, 2022

1. Clone this repository to your computer, and if you have it on your computer already, run git pull from within the folder. Very important.
2. Switch to your branch which you used for the first task. Use "git branch" to check the available branches, and use "git checkout -b YOUR-BRANCH" to switch to it. If you don't find your branch there, then you most likely haven't done the first task, and if you feel otherwise, let me know in the group.
3. Create a simple bash script named YOUR-USERNAME.sh. This script should output "My username is YOUR-USERNAME" when it is run.
4. For advanced or experienced users of bash scripting, assume that you don't know the install location or path of the bash script on the target machine. Let the bash script refect this.
5. Your submission will contain three files - LICENSE, README.md, and YOUR-USERNAME.sh.
6. No Pull Requests please. Just notify me in the group after you've pushed your solution to your branch.
